{"Problem_4": "This problem involves the concepts of modular arithmetic and quadratic residues. \n\nModular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers \"wrap around\" when reaching a certain value, the modulus. In this problem, the modulus is $n$.\n\nA quadratic residue is an integer that is a perfect square modulo $n$. In other words, an integer $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $n$ if there exists an integer $x$ such that $x^2 \\equiv a (\\mathrm{mod} \\, n)$.\n\nThe problem asks us to find the number of integers $k$ that satisfy the conditions given in the problem for $n = 2020$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Factorize the number $n$**: The first step is to factorize the number $n = 2020$. This is important because the properties of quadratic residues depend on the prime factorization of the modulus.\n\n2. **Find the quadratic residues modulo $n$**: The next step is to find the quadratic residues modulo $n$. This will help us determine the possible values of $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.\n\n3. **Find the possible values of $xyz$ modulo $n$**: The final step is to find the possible values of $xyz$ modulo $n$. This will give us the possible values of $k$.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\n1. **Factorization**: The prime factorization of a number is unique (up to the order of the factors). This is a fundamental theorem of arithmetic. In this problem, we need to factorize $n$ to understand its structure and how it affects the quadratic residues.\n\n2. **Quadratic residues**: The quadratic residues modulo $n$ are determined by the prime factorization of $n$. For each prime factor $p$ of $n$, there are exactly $(p+1)/2$ quadratic residues modulo $p$. The quadratic residues modulo $n$ are the numbers that can be obtained by multiplying the quadratic residues modulo each prime factor of $n$.\n\n3. **Modular multiplication**: The product $xyz$ modulo $n$ can be any integer between $0$ and $n-1$. This is because the product of three integers modulo $n$ is the same as the product of their residues modulo $n$.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\n1. **Factorization**: We can verify the factorization of $n$ by multiplying the factors together and checking that the result is $n$.\n\n2. **Quadratic residues**: We can verify the quadratic residues by squaring each residue modulo $n$ and checking that the result is a quadratic residue.\n\n3. **Modular multiplication**: We can verify the possible values of $xyz$ modulo $n$ by multiplying three integers modulo $n$ and checking that the result is in the range $0$ to $n-1$.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\n1. **Assumptions**: We assume that $n$ is a positive integer. This is necessary for the definitions of modular arithmetic and quadratic residues to make sense.\n\n2. **Potential errors**: The main source of error in this problem is in the calculation of the quadratic residues and the possible values of $xyz$ modulo $n$. These calculations can be complex and error-prone, especially for large values of $n$.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to factorize $n$, find the quadratic residues modulo $n$, and find the possible values of $xyz$ modulo $n$. The number of fans of $n$ is the number of integers $k$ that satisfy the conditions given in the problem. This problem involves the concepts of modular arithmetic and quadratic residues, and requires careful calculation and verification."}

{"Problem_10": "## Detailed Problem Analysis\n\nThis problem is a combinatorial problem involving number theory. The key mathematical concepts and techniques needed to solve this problem include:\n\n1. Understanding of powers of 2: Powers of 2 are numbers of the form $2^n$ where n is a non-negative integer. The first few powers of 2 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.\n\n2. Understanding of inequalities: The problem involves the inequalities $a \\leq b \\leq c$ which means that a is less than or equal to b and b is less than or equal to c.\n\n3. Understanding of positive integers: Positive integers are all the whole numbers greater than zero.\n\n4. Combinatorial reasoning: The problem asks for the number of sets of positive integers that satisfy certain conditions. This requires combinatorial reasoning to count the number of such sets.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Step 1**: Start by considering the smallest possible values for a, b, and c. Since they are positive integers, the smallest possible value for each is 1. \n\n2. **Step 2**: Substitute these values into the expressions $ab - c$, $bc - a$, and $ca - b$ and check if they are powers of 2. \n\n3. **Step 3**: If they are not, increment the values of a, b, and c while maintaining the inequalities $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and repeat step 2. \n\n4. **Step 4**: Continue this process until all possible values of a, b, and c have been considered. \n\n5. **Step 5**: Count the number of sets of values for a, b, and c that satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\nThe method used in this solution is a brute force method.

{"Problem_11": "## Detailed Problem Analysis\n\nThis problem involves the concept of floor functions, range of functions, and the concept of minimum value of a function. \n\nThe floor function, denoted as $[x]$, is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. The range of a function is the set of all possible output values (y-values) that we get after substituting all the possible input values in the function.\n\nIn this problem, we are given a function $f(x) =[x[x]]$, and we are asked to find the minimum value of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$, where $a_n$ is the number of elements in the range set of $f(x)$ when $x \\in [0,n)$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the function $f(x)$**: The function $f(x) =[x[x]]$ is a composition of two floor functions. The inner floor function $[x]$ gives the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, and the outer floor function $[x[x]]$ gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the product $x[x]$.\n\n2. **Finding the range of $f(x)$**: The range of $f(x)$ is the set of all possible output values of $f(x)$. To find the range of $f(x)$, we need to consider all possible values of $x$ in the interval $[0,n)$.\n\n3. **Calculating $a_n$**: The number $a_n$ is the number of elements in the range set of $f(x)$ when $x \\in [0,n)$. To find $a_n$, we need to count the number of distinct values that $f(x)$ can take in the interval $[0,n)$.\n\n4. **Finding the minimum value of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$**: Once we have found $a_n$, we can substitute it into the expression $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$ and find its minimum value.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\n1. **Understanding the function $f(x)$**: The floor function $[x]$ is a piecewise constant function that jumps at every integer. The function $f(x) =[x[x]]$ is also a piecewise constant function, but it jumps at every integer multiple of $x$.\n\n2. **Finding the range of $f(x)$**: The range of $f(x)$ is determined by the values that $x[x]$ can take. Since $x$ is in the interval $[0,n)$, the product $x[x]$ can take any value in the interval $[0,n^2)$.\n\n3. **Calculating $a_n$**: The number $a_n$ is the number of distinct values that $f(x)$ can take in the interval $[0,n)$. Since $f(x)$ is a piecewise constant function, the number of distinct values that it can take is equal to the number of jumps that it makes in the interval $[0,n)$.\n\n4. **Finding the minimum value of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$**: The expression $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$ is a rational function of $n$. The minimum value of a rational function occurs either at a critical point or at an endpoint of its domain.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\n1. **Understanding the function $f(x)$**: The function $f(x) =[x[x]]$ is well-defined for all real numbers $x$.\n\n2. **Finding the range of $f(x)$**: The range of $f(x)$ is a subset of the set of all integers. Therefore, it is a countable set.\n\n3. **Calculating $a_n$**: The number $a_n$ is a non-negative integer. It is equal to the number of jumps that $f(x)$ makes in the interval $[0,n)$.\n\n4. **Finding the minimum value of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$**: The minimum value of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$ is a real number. It can be found by taking the derivative of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$ with respect to $n$ and setting it equal to zero.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\n1. **Assumptions**: We assume that $n$ is a positive integer. If $n$ is not a positive integer, the problem does not make sense.\n\n2. **Potential Errors**: The main source of error in this problem is in the calculation of $a_n$. If we miscount the number of jumps that $f(x)$ makes in the interval $[0,n)$, we will get the wrong value for $a_n$.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nIn conclusion, the problem involves finding the minimum value of a rational function of $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer and $a_n$ is the number of elements in the range set of a piecewise constant function $f(x)$. The solution involves understanding the behavior of the function $f(x)$, finding its range, calculating $a_n$, and finding the minimum value of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$. The main challenge in this problem is in the calculation of $a_n$, which requires careful counting of the number of jumps that $f(x)$ makes in the interval $[0,n)$.\n\nThe final solution to this problem requires further calculations and analysis, which are beyond the scope of this initial analysis. The next steps would involve a detailed calculation of $a_n$ and the minimum value of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$ for different values of $n$."}

We know that $2^n - 1 - C_n^4 - C_n^5 - ... - C_n^n$ must be a power of 2, since $2^{2000}$ is a power of 2. \n\nWe also know that $n$ must be greater than 3. So, we can start by checking the values of $n$ from 4 onwards.\n\n**Step 4:** Sum all the values of $n$ that satisfy the condition.\n\nOnce we have found all the values of $n$ that satisfy the condition, we can sum them to get the final answer.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\nThe binomial theorem is used to simplify the expression $1+C_n^1+C_n^2+C_n^3$. The concept of divisibility is used to find the values of $n$ that satisfy the condition. The natural numbers are used to limit the possible values of $n$.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\nThe calculations can be verified by checking that $2^n - 1 - C_n^4 - C_n^5 - ... - C_n^n$ is indeed a power of 2 for each value of $n$ that satisfies the condition.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\nThe main assumption made in this solution is that $n$ is a natural number greater than 3. If $n$ is not a natural number or is less than or equal to 3, the solution may not be valid.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nThe problem involves finding the sum of all natural numbers $n$ greater than 3 such that $1+C_n^1+C_n^2+C_n^3$ divides $2^{2000}$. The solution involves using the binomial theorem to simplify the expression, finding the values of $n$ that satisfy the condition, and summing these values.

{"Problem_79": "## Detailed Problem Analysis\n\nThis problem is a classic example of optimization in multivariable calculus. We are given a constraint equation (the equation $4x^2 + 4y^2 + z^2 + 2z = 3$) and an objective function (the expression $5x + 4y + 3z$) that we want to minimize. \n\nThe key mathematical concepts involved in this problem are:\n\n1. **Multivariable Calculus**: This problem involves multiple variables (x, y, z) and requires the use of calculus to find the minimum value of the objective function.\n\n2. **Optimization**: We are asked to find the minimum value of the objective function subject to a constraint, which is a common problem in optimization.\n\n3. **Quadratic Forms**: The constraint equation is a quadratic form, which can be rewritten in a more convenient form to simplify the problem.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1**: Rewrite the constraint equation in a more convenient form.\n\nThe constraint equation can be rewritten as $(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (z+1)^2 = 4$. This is the equation of a sphere in 3D space with radius 2 and center at the origin (0,0,-1).\n\n**Step 2**: Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum of the objective function subject to the constraint.\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers is a technique in calculus for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints. It involves introducing a new variable (the Lagrange multiplier) and forming a new function (the Lagrangian) that combines the objective function and the constraint.\n\n**Step 3**: Solve the system of equations obtained from the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nThis involves taking the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to each variable and setting them equal to zero, then solving the resulting system of equations.\n\n**Step 4**: Check the solution obtained in Step 3 to ensure it is a minimum.\n\nThis can be done by computing the second derivatives of the Lagrangian and forming the Hessian matrix, then checking its definiteness.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers is based on the observation that at a maximum or minimum, the gradient of the objective function is parallel to the gradient of the constraint. This leads to a system of equations that can be solved to find the maximum or minimum.\n\nThe Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function. Its definiteness can be used to determine whether a critical point is a maximum, minimum, or saddle point.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\nThe calculations involved in this problem are mainly algebraic manipulations and solving systems of equations, which can be checked by substitution and simplification.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\nThe main assumption in this problem is that the variables x, y, z are non-negative real numbers. If this assumption is not met, the solution may not be valid.\n\nThere may be errors in the calculations if the system of equations obtained from the method of Lagrange multipliers is not solved correctly. It is also possible that the solution obtained is a local minimum rather than a global minimum, in which case the method of Lagrange multipliers would not give the correct answer.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nIn conclusion, this problem involves finding the minimum of a function subject to a constraint, which is a common problem in optimization. The method of Lagrange multipliers is a powerful tool for solving such problems, but care must be taken to ensure the solution obtained is a global minimum. The solution can be checked by computing the Hessian matrix and checking its definiteness."}

So, $\\overrightarrow{O A} = (a, 0)$, $\\overrightarrow{O B} = (0, b)$, and $\\overrightarrow{O D} = (x, y)$ where D is $(x, y)$.\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of the vectors**: The sum of the vectors is simply the sum of their components. So, $\\overrightarrow{O A}+\\overrightarrow{O B}+\\overrightarrow{O D} = (a+x, b+y)$.\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitude of the sum of the vectors**: The magnitude of a vector $(x, y)$ is $\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$. So, $|\\overrightarrow{O A}+\\overrightarrow{O B}+\\overrightarrow{O D}| = \\sqrt{(a+x)^{2}+(b+y)^{2}}$.\n\n4. **Use the given condition to find a relationship between a, b, x, and y**: The problem states that $|\\overrightarrow{O A}+\\overrightarrow{O B}+\\overrightarrow{O D}| \\leq 6$. So, we have $\\sqrt{(a+x)^{2}+(b+y)^{2}} \\leq 6$.\n\n5. **Use the condition that $|C D|=1$ to find a relationship between x and y**: The distance between two points $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ is $\\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$. So, $|C D| = \\sqrt{(x-0)^{2}+(y-4)^{2}} = 1$. This gives us $(x-0)^{2}+(y-4)^{2} = 1$.\n\n6. **Solve the equations from steps 4 and 5 to find the minimum value of $a^{2}+b^{2}$**: This is a system of two equations in four variables. We can solve this system to find the minimum value of $a^{2}+b^{2}$.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\nThe problem involves the concepts of vectors, their sum, and their magnitude. The sum of two vectors is obtained by adding their components, and the magnitude of a vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. The problem also involves the concept of distance in a plane, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences of the coordinates of the points.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\nThe calculations involve algebraic manipulations and solving a system of equations. We can check the calculations by substituting the solutions back into the equations and verifying that they satisfy the equations.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\nWe are assuming that the points A, B, C, and D are distinct and that the distance between C and D is always 1. We are also assuming that the maximum value of the magnitude of the sum of the vectors is 6. If these assumptions are not true, the solution may not be valid.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nThe problem involves finding the minimum value of $a^{2}+b^{2}$ given certain conditions involving vectors and distances in a plane. The solution involves calculating the vectors, their sum, and their magnitude, and using the given conditions to find a relationship between the variables. The minimum value of $a^{2}+b^{2}$ is then found by solving a system of equations. The solution is verified by substituting the solutions back into the equations.

We can substitute this into the equation:\n\n$1 - \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\tan a}{1 - \\tan^2 a} \\cos a = \\frac{2 \\tan a}{1 - \\tan^2 a}$\n\n### Step 4: Solve for $\\tan a$\n\nWe can solve this equation for $\\tan a$ by using algebraic methods. This will give us the value of $\\tan a$, which we can then use to find the value of $a$.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\nThe trigonometric identities and the double-angle formula are standard results in trigonometry. They are derived from the definitions of the trigonometric functions and the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThe algebraic methods used to solve the equation for $\\tan a$ are standard techniques in algebra. They involve manipulating the equation to isolate $\\tan a$ on one side.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\nAfter solving the equation for $\\tan a$, we can check our solution by substitifying it back into the original equation. If the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, then our solution is correct.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\nWe are assuming that $a$ is an acute angle not exceeding $45^\\circ$. This means that $0^\\circ < a \\leq 45^\\circ$. If $a$ is outside this range, then our solution may not be valid.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nTo solve the problem, we first rewrite the given equation using trigonometric identities. We then simplify the equation and use the double-angle formula to express it in terms of $\\tan a$. Finally, we solve the equation for $\\tan a$ and use this to find the value of $a$.\n\nThe solution process involves the use of trigonometric identities, the double-angle formula, and algebraic methods. The correctness of the solution can be verified by substituting the solution back into the original equation. The solution is valid for acute angles not exceeding $45^\\circ$.\n\nThe final solution will be presented in the next step."}

{"Problem_100": "**Detailed Problem Analysis**\n\nThe problem involves the concepts of geometry, specifically circles and quadrilaterals, and calculus, specifically optimization. The task is to find the maximum area of a quadrilateral formed by two mutually perpendicular lines intersecting a circle at four points. \n\nThe circle's equation is given as $x^2 + y^2 = 4$, which is a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2. The point P(2,1) is given, and it lies on the circle. The two lines passing through P are perpendicular to each other and intersect the circle at points A, B, C, and D. \n\nThe area of a quadrilateral can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 times the base times the height. In this case, the base and height of the quadrilateral are the distances between the points of intersection of the lines with the circle. \n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to use calculus to find the maximum value of the area function. This involves taking the derivative of the area function, setting it equal to zero, and solving for the variable. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Find the equations of the lines**: Since the lines are perpendicular and pass through the point P(2,1), their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. Let's denote the slope of the line passing through A and B as m. Then, the slope of the line passing through C and D is -1/m. The equations of the lines are then y - 1 = m(x - 2) and y - 1 = -1/m(x - 2).\n\n2. **Find the points of intersection with the circle**: Substitute the equations of the lines into the equation of the circle and solve for x and y. This will give the coordinates of the points A, B, C, and D.\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the quadrilateral**: The area of the quadrilateral is the sum of the areas of two triangles, each formed by the line segment connecting P to the points of intersection and the line segment connecting the points of intersection. The area of a triangle is 1/2 times the base times the height, so the area of the quadrilateral is the sum of these two areas.\n\n4. **Find the maximum area**: Take the derivative of the area function with respect to m, set it equal to zero, and solve for m. This will give the slope of the lines that yield the maximum area. Substitute this value back into the equations of the lines to find the points of intersection, and then calculate the maximum area.\n\n**Theoretical Justification**\n\nThe method used to solve this problem is based on the principles of geometry and calculus. The geometry concepts involve the properties of circles and quadrilaterals, and the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines. The calculus concepts involve the process of optimization, which is used to find the maximum or minimum value of a function.\n\n**Calculation Verification**\n\nAfter each step, verify the calculations by checking that the points of intersection satisfy the equations of the lines and the circle, and that the area function is correctly derived and solved.\n\n**Error Checking and Assumptions**\n\nThe main assumption in this problem is that the lines intersect the circle at distinct points. If the lines are tangent to the circle, then the points of intersection would coincide and the area of the quadrilateral would be zero. \n\n**Conclusive Summary**\n\nThe solution to this problem involves finding the equations of two perpendicular lines passing through a given point, finding their points of intersection with a given circle, calculating the area of the quadrilateral formed by these points, and then using calculus to find the maximum area. The key concepts used in this solution are the properties of circles and quadrilaterals, the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines, and the process of optimization. \n\nThe final answer will be provided after the calculations are performed."}

The probability of success, denoted by P, is the same on every trial.\n4. The trials are independent; the outcome on one trial does not affect the outcome on other trials.\n\nIn this problem, the binomial experiment is flipping an unfair coin 5 times. The two possible outcomes are getting a head (success) or getting a tail (failure). The probability of getting a head is denoted by P, and the probability of getting a tail is 1-P because the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * (P^k) * ((1-P)^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials,\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time,\n- P is the probability of success on a single trial, and\n- n is the number of trials.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1:** Set up the equation based on the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that the probability of getting exactly 1 head is equal to the probability of getting exactly 2 heads.

{"Problem_259": "## Problem Analysis\n\nThe problem is asking us to find the measure of angle B in a triangle ABC, given the lengths of the sides a, b, and c. \n\nIn a triangle, the sides opposite the angles are usually denoted by the same letters. So, side a is opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B, and side c is opposite angle C.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to solve this problem. The Law of Cosines is a formula used in geometry to find a side length or angle in a triangle. It is most useful for solving for missing information in a triangle when you have the lengths of all three sides.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c, and an angle \u03b3 between sides a and b, the following equation holds:\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos(\u03b3)\n\nIn this problem, we know the lengths of all three sides (a = 9, b = 12, c = 16), and we want to find the measure of angle B (\u03b3 in the formula). We can rearrange the Law of Cosines to solve for cos(\u03b3), and then use the inverse cosine function to find the measure of angle B.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Rearrange the Law of Cosines to solve for cos(B)**: We can rearrange the formula to solve for cos(B) as follows:\n\n    cos(B) = (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2) / (2ac)\n\n2. **Substitute the given side lengths into the formula**: Substituting a = 9, b = 12, and c = 16 into the formula gives us:\n\n    cos(B) = (9\u00b2 + 16\u00b2 - 12\u00b2) / (2 * 9 * 16)\n\n3. **Calculate the value of cos(B)**: Evaluating the right-hand side of the equation gives us the value of cos(B).\n\n4. **Find the measure of angle B**: We can find the measure of angle B by taking the inverse cosine (also known as arccos) of the value we found for cos(B). The result will be in radians, so we need to convert it to degrees by multiplying by 180/\u03c0.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\nWe can verify our calculations by checking that the value we find for cos(B) is between -1 and 1, which is the range of the cosine function. After finding the measure of angle B, we can check that it is between 0 and 180 degrees, which is the range of angles in a triangle.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\nWe are assuming that the given side lengths form a triangle. If they do not, the Law of Cosines may not give a valid result. We can check this assumption by verifying that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side, which is a necessary condition for three lengths to form a triangle.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nBy applying the Law of Cosines and using the given side lengths, we can find the measure of angle B in the triangle. The steps involve rearranging the Law of Cosines to solve for cos(B), substituting the given side lengths into the formula, calculating the value of cos(B), and finding the measure of angle B by taking the inverse cosine of the value we found for cos(B). We can verify our calculations by checking that the values we find are within the valid ranges for the cosine function and angles in a triangle.\n\nLet's perform these calculations now."}

The integral is of the form $\\displaystyle{\\int_a^b f(x) dx}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the limits of integration, and $f(x)$ is the function to be integrated.\n\nThe function to be integrated, $f(x) = 2x - \\sqrt{16 - x^2}$, is a combination of a linear function and a square root function. \n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if a function $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a, b]$ and $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on $[a, b]$, then $\\displaystyle{\\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)}$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Find the antiderivative of $f(x)$**: The antiderivative of a function $f(x)$, also known as the indefinite integral, is a function $F(x)$ whose derivative is $f(x)$. We will find the antiderivative of $f(x) = 2x - \\sqrt{16 - x^2}$.\n\n2. **Evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration**: Once we have the antiderivative $F(x)$, we will evaluate it at the upper limit of integration $b = 4$ and the lower limit of integration $a = 0$.\n\n3. **Subtract the values obtained in step 2**: The value of the definite integral is given by $F(b) - F(a)$.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\n1. **Find the antiderivative of $f(x)$**: The antiderivative of $2x$ is $x^2$. The antiderivative of $\\sqrt{16 - x^2}$ is a bit more complex. We can rewrite $\\sqrt{16 - x^2}$ as $(16 - x^2)^{1/2}$ and use the method of substitution to find its antiderivative. Let $u = 16 - x^2$, then $du = -2x dx$. The antiderivative of $u^{1/2}$ with respect to $u$ is $\\frac{2}{3}u^{3/2}$.\n\n2. **Evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration**: This step is straightforward. We simply substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the antiderivative function $F(x)$.\n\n3. **Subtract the values obtained in step 2**: This step is also straightforward. We simply subtract the value of $F(a)$ from the value of $F(b)$.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\nWe will verify our calculations at each step by checking that they are consistent with the rules of calculus and algebra.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\nWe assume that the function $f(x)$ is continuous on the interval $[0, 4]$. If this assumption is not valid, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus may not apply, and our method of solving the problem may not be correct.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nOnce we have completed all the steps, we will have the value of the definite integral. This value represents the signed area under the curve $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 4$. The sign of the area depends on whether $f(x)$ is positive or negative on the interval $[0, 4]$.\n\nLet's start the calculations."}

{"Problem_325": "This problem involves the concept of limits in calculus. Specifically, it requires the use of L'Hopital's Rule, which is a method for finding the limit of a quotient of two functions that approach zero or infinity as the variable approaches a certain value. \n\nL'Hopital's Rule states that if the limit of a quotient of two functions as x approaches a certain value is of the form 0/0 or \u221e/\u221e, then the limit of the quotient is equal to the limit of the quotient of their derivatives.\n\nIn this problem, we are asked to find the limit of the function $\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x}$ as x approaches 0. \n\nLet's start by checking if the limit is of the form 0/0 or \u221e/\u221e.\n\n## Step 1: Check the form of the limit\n\nAs x approaches 0, the numerator $(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e$ approaches $e-e=0$ and the denominator x also approaches 0. So, the limit is of the form 0/0, and we can apply L'Hopital's Rule.\n\n## Step 2: Apply L'Hopital's Rule\n\nTo apply L'Hopital's Rule, we need to find the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe derivative of the denominator x is 1.\n\nThe derivative of the numerator $(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e$ is a bit more complex. We can use the chain rule and the power rule to find it. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. The power rule states that the derivative of $x^n$ is $nx^{n-1}$.\n\nLet's denote $f(x) = (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e$. Then, $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}] - \\frac{d}{dx}[e] = \\frac{d}{dx}[(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}] - 0 = \\frac{d}{dx}[(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}]$.\n\nTo find the derivative of $(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}$, we can rewrite it as $e^{ln((1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}})} = e^{\\frac{1}{x}ln(1+x)}$ and then apply the chain rule and the power rule.\n\nSo, $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[e^{\\frac{1}{x}ln(1+x)}] = e^{\\frac{1}{x}ln(1+x)} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}[\\frac{1}{x}ln(1+x)]$.\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of $\\frac{1}{x}ln(1+x)$. We can use the quotient rule, which states that the derivative of $\\frac{u}{v}$ is $\\frac{vu' - uv'}{v^2}$, where u and v are functions of x, and u' and v' are their derivatives.\n\nLet's denote $u = ln(1+x)$ and $v = x$. Then, $u' = \\frac{1}{1+x}$ and $v' = 1$.\n\nSo, $\\frac{d}{dx}[\\frac{1}{x}ln(1+x)] = \\frac{x\\frac{1}{1+x} - ln(1+x)}{x^2} = \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)}$.\n\nTherefore, $f'(x) = e^{\\frac{1}{x}ln(1+x)} \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)} = (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)}$.\n\nNow, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule and find the limit of the quotient of the derivatives as x approaches 0.\n\n## Step 3: Find the limit of the quotient of the derivatives\n\n$\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)}}{1}$.\n\nAs x approaches 0, the numerator $(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)}$ approaches $e \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1)}{0} = e \\cdot \\frac{1 - 0}{0} = \\infty$ and the denominator 1 remains constant. So, the limit is of the form \u221e/\u221e, and we can apply L'Hopital's Rule again.\n\nThe derivative of the denominator 1 is 0.\n\nThe derivative of the numerator $(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)}$ is a bit more complex. We can use the product rule, the chain rule, and the power rule to find it. The product rule states that the derivative of the product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function.\n\nLet's denote $g(x) = (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)}$. Then, $g'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}] \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)} + (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}[\\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)}]$.\n\nWe have already found the derivative of $(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}$ in Step 2.\n\nTo find the derivative of $\\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)}$, we can use the quotient rule again.\n\nLet's denote $u = 1 - ln(1+x)$ and $v = x(1+x)$. Then, $u' = -\\frac{1}{1+x}$ and $v' = 1 + 2x$.\n\nSo, $\\frac{d}{dx}[\\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)}] = \\frac{x(1+x)(-\\frac{1}{1+x}) - (1 - ln(1+x))(1 + 2x)}{(x(1+x))^2} = \\frac{-x - (1 + 2x) + (1 + 2x)ln(1+x)}{x^2(1+x)^2}$.\n\nTherefore, $g'(x) = (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)} \\cdot -\\frac{x + (1 + 2x) - (1 + 2x)ln(1+x)}{x^2(1+x)^2} + (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{-x - (1 + 2x) + (1 + 2x)ln(1+x)}{x^2(1+x)^2}$.\n\nNow, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule again and find the limit of the quotient of the derivatives as x approaches 0.\n\n## Step 4: Find the limit of the quotient of the derivatives again\n\n$\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)}}{1} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)} \\cdot -\\frac{x + (1 + 2x) - (1 + 2x)ln(1+x)}{x^2(1+x)^2} + (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{-x - (1 + 2x) + (1 + 2x)ln(1+x)}{x^2(1+x)^2}}{0}$.\n\nAs x approaches 0, the numerator $(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1+x)}{x(1+x)} \\cdot -\\frac{x + (1 + 2x) - (1 + 2x)ln(1+x)}{x^2(1+x)^2} + (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\cdot \\frac{-x - (1 + 2x) + (1 + 2x)ln(1+x)}{x^2(1+x)^2}$ approaches $e \\cdot \\frac{1 - ln(1)}{0} \\cdot -\\frac{0 + (1 + 2*0) - (1 + 2*0)ln(1)}{0^2(1+0)^2} + e \\cdot \\frac{-0 - (1 + 2*0) + (1 + 2*0)ln(1)}{0^2(1+0)^2} = \\infty$ and the denominator"}

We are asked to find the value of $n$ that maximizes the probability $P(N=n)$.\n\nThe key mathematical concepts involved in this problem are combinatorics and probability. We will need to calculate the probability of drawing a matching pair of socks on the $n$-th draw and then find the value of $n$ that maximizes this probability.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Calculate the probability of drawing a matching pair on the $n$-th draw**: To do this, we need to consider all possible ways of drawing $n-1$ socks without getting a pair, and then drawing one more sock that matches one of the previously drawn socks.\n\n2. **Find the value of $n$ that maximizes this probability**: Once we have an expression for $P(N=n)$, we can find the value of $n$ that maximizes this probability by examining the function for different values of $n$.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\n1. **Probability of drawing a matching pair on the $n$-th draw**: The total number of ways to draw $n-1$ socks without getting a pair is given by the product of the number of ways to choose $n-1$ different colors of socks and the number of ways to choose one sock of each chosen color. The number of ways to draw one more sock that matches one of the previously drawn socks is simply $n-1$. The total number of ways to draw $n$ socks is given by the product of the number of ways to choose $n$ different colors of socks and the number of ways to choose one sock of each chosen color. The probability $P(N=n)$ is then given by the ratio of these two quantities.\n\n2. **Finding the value of $n$ that maximizes $P(N=n)$**: This can be done by examining the function $P(N=n)$ for different values of $n$. Since the function is discrete, we can simply calculate the value of the function for each possible value of $n$ and choose the one that gives the maximum value.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\nWe will verify our calculations by ensuring that the probabilities sum to 1 and by checking that the calculated probabilities match our intuition about the problem.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\nWe are assuming that the socks are drawn randomly and that each sock is equally likely to be drawn. We are also assuming that the socks are drawn without replacement, i.e., once a sock is drawn, it is not put back into the drawer.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nBy calculating the probability of drawing a matching pair of socks on the $n$-th draw and finding the value of $n$ that maximizes this probability, we can solve the problem.

We are asked to find the fourth moment of the sum of these variables, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[T^4]$ where $T = X + Y + Z$.\n\nThe moment generating function (MGF) of a random variable is a function that provides a convenient way to calculate moments (expected values of powers of the random variable). The $n$-th derivative of the MGF evaluated at zero gives the $n$-th moment of the random variable.\n\nSince $X, Y, Z$ are independent, the MGF of their sum $T$ is the product of their individual MGFs. Therefore, we can find the MGF of $T$, differentiate it four times, and evaluate at zero to find $\\mathbb{E}[T^4]$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Find the MGF of $T$**: Since $X, Y, Z$ are independent, the MGF of $T = X + Y + Z$ is the product of the MGFs of $X, Y, Z$. That is, $M_T(t) = M_X(t)M_Y(t)M_Z(t)$.\n\n2. **Differentiate $M_T(t)$ four times**: The fourth derivative of $M_T(t)$ evaluated at zero gives $\\mathbb{E}[T^4]$.

There must be another mistake in our calculations.\n\nUpon reviewing our work again, we see that we made a mistake in the computation of the probability that the next realization of $N$ is greater than 1 given $\\Lambda$. The correct probability should be:\n\n$$P(N > 1|\\Lambda) = 1 - P(N \\leq 1|\\Lambda) = 1 - P(N = 0|\\Lambda) - P(N = 1|\\Lambda) = 1 - e^{-\\Lambda} - \\Lambda e^{-\\Lambda}.$$\n\nBut we need to multiply this by the Poisson probability mass function for $N = 2$, which is:\n\n$$P(N = 2|\\Lambda) = \\frac{\\Lambda^2 e^{-\\Lambda}}{2!} = \\frac{1}{2} \\Lambda^2 e^{-\\Lambda}.$$\n\nSo, the correct probability that the next realization of $N$ is greater than 1 given the observed data is:\n\n$$P(N > 1|N_1,N_2) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\left(1 - e^{-\\lambda} - \\lambda e^{-\\lambda}\\right) \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda^2 e^{-\\lambda} \\frac{1}{3} \\lambda^3 e^{-3\\lambda}d\\lambda.$$\n\nThis integral is still a bit tricky to compute directly, but we can use numerical methods to approximate the value. \n\nLet's denote the integral as $I$:\n\n$$I = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\left(1 - e^{-\\lambda} - \\lambda e^{-\\lambda}\\right) \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda^2 e^{-\\lambda} \\frac{1}{3} \\lambda^3 e^{-3\\lambda}d\\lambda.$$\n\nWe can split the integral into three parts:\n\n$$I = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{6} \\lambda^5 e^{-4\\lambda}d\\lambda - \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{6} \\lambda^6 e^{-5\\lambda}d\\lambda - \\int_0^"}
