This involves algebraic manipulation and possibly solving a quadratic equation.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given equation\n\nThe given equation is $\\frac{25}{8}k-211 = \\text{product of the digits of } k$. \n\nThis equation tells us that the product of the digits of $k$ is a linear function of $k$. \n\n### Step 2: Consider the possible values of $k$\n\nSince $k$ is a positive integer, the product of its digits is also a positive integer. Therefore, the right-hand side of the equation, $\\frac{25}{8}k-211$, must also be a positive integer. \n\nThis means that $k$ must be a multiple of 8, because otherwise the right-hand side of the equation would not be an integer. \n\n### Step 3: Solve the equation for $k$\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{25}{8}k = \\text{product of the digits of } k + 211$.\n\nSince $k$ is a multiple of 8, we can write $k = 8n$ for some positive integer $n$. Substituting this into the equation gives $\\frac{25}{8} \\cdot 8n = \\text{product of the digits of } 8n + 211$.\n\nSimplifying this gives $25n = \\text{product of the digits of } 8n + 211$.\n\nWe can now solve this equation for $n$ by trying different values of $n$ and checking whether the equation holds.\n\n### Step 4: Find the sum of all $k$ that satisfy the equation\n\nOnce we have found all values of $n$ that satisfy the equation, we can find the corresponding values of $k$ by multiplying each $n$ by 8. The sum of all $k$ is then the sum of these values.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\nThe key theoretical principle applied in this solution is the concept of a linear function. The given equation is a linear function of $k$, which means that the product of the digits of $k$ increases linearly with $k$.\n\nThe solution also relies on the fact that the product of the digits of a number is an integer. This is why $k$ must be a multiple of 8, because otherwise the right-hand side of the equation would not be an integer.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\nThe calculations in this solution can be verified by checking that the equation holds for each value of $n$ that we find. This involves calculating the product of the digits of $8n$ and checking that it equals $25n - 211$.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\nThe main assumption in this solution is that $k$ is a multiple of 8. This is based on the fact that the right-hand side of the equation must be an integer. If this assumption is incorrect, the solution would be invalid.\n\nThere could also be errors in the calculations, especially when calculating the product of the digits of $8n$. It is important to check these calculations carefully.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nIn conclusion, the solution to this problem involves analyzing the given equation, considering the possible values of $k$, solving the equation for $k$, and finding the sum of all $k$ that satisfy the equation. The solution relies on the concepts of number theory and algebra, and the calculations can be verified by checking that the equation holds for each value of $n$ that we find. The main assumption is that $k$ is a multiple of 8, and it is important to check the calculations carefully to avoid errors."}
{"Problem_40": "This problem involves the concepts of number theory, specifically the properties of digits in a number, and quadratic equations. The task is to find all integers $n$ such that the product of its digits times 10 equals $n^2 + 4n - 2005$, and then sum all such $n$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the range of $n$**: Since $p(n)$ is the product of the digits of $n$, $n$ must be a positive integer. Also, $10p(n)$ must be less than or equal to $n^2 + 4n - 2005$. This implies that $n$ must be greater than or equal to $\\sqrt{2005}$, which is approximately 44.77. Therefore, $n$ must be an integer greater than or equal to 45.\n\n2. **Solve the quadratic equation for each $n$ in the range**: For each $n$ in the range, solve the quadratic equation $10p(n) = n^2 + 4n - 2005$. If the equation holds true, then $n$ is a solution.\n\n3. **Sum all solutions**: After finding all solutions, sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Identify the range of $n$**: As mentioned above, $n$ must be an integer greater than or equal to 45.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second step:\n\n2. **Solve the quadratic equation for each $n$ in the range**: We can start by checking $n = 45$ and continue with increasing values of $n$. For each $n$, calculate $p(n)$, which is the product of the digits of $n$, and check if $10p(n) = n^2 + 4n - 2005$.\n\nFinally, the third step:\n\n3. **Sum all solutions**: After finding all solutions, sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nLet's perform these steps and find the solution."}
{"Problem_41": "The problem is asking for the sum of all positive integers that satisfy the condition that each pair of adjacent digits forms a perfect square. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of perfect squares and the properties of digits in a number. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself. For example, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100 are perfect squares. \n\nThe properties of digits in a number are also important. In a number, each digit has a place value, and the value of the number is the sum of the values of its digits. For example, in the number 123, the digit 1 has a place value of 100, the digit 2 has a place value of 10, and the digit 3 has a place value of 1. The value of the number 123 is 1*100 + 2*10 + 3*1 = 123.\n\nThe problem can be solved by systematically checking all possible combinations of digits that form perfect squares and summing up the resulting numbers.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.

{"Problem_100": "**Detailed Problem Analysis:**\n\nThe problem involves the concepts of geometry, specifically circles and quadrilaterals, and calculus, specifically optimization. The task is to find the maximum area of a quadrilateral formed by two mutually perpendicular lines intersecting a circle at four points. \n\nThe circle's equation is given as $x^2 + y^2 = 4$, which is a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2. The point P(2,1) is given, and it lies on the circle. Two mutually perpendicular lines are drawn through point P, intersecting the circle at points A, B, C, and D. \n\nThe area of a quadrilateral can be calculated by dividing it into two triangles and adding their areas. The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula 1/2 * base * height. \n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to use calculus, specifically the concept of optimization. We need to find the function that represents the area of the quadrilateral, take its derivative, set it equal to zero, and solve for the variable. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. Find the equations of the two lines passing through P(2,1) and perpendicular to each other. \n\n2. Find the points of intersection of these lines with the circle.\n\n3. Express the area of the quadrilateral as a function of a variable.\n\n4. Differentiate this function and set it equal to zero to find the maximum area.\n\n**Theoretical Justification:**\n\n1. The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + c$, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. Since the lines are perpendicular, their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. If one line has a slope of m, the other line has a slope of -1/m. Since the lines pass through P(2,1), we can substitute these values into the equation to find the y-intercepts.\n\n2. The points of intersection of a line and a circle can be found by substitifying the equation of the line into the equation of the circle and solving for the variables.\n\n3. The area of a quadrilateral can be expressed as the sum of the areas of two triangles. The area of a triangle is given by 1/2 * base * height.\n\n4. The maximum or minimum of a function occurs where its derivative is zero. By differentiating the area function and setting it equal to zero, we can find the value of the variable that gives the maximum area.\n\n**Calculation Verification:**\n\nAfter each step, we can verify the calculations by substituting the values back into the equations and checking if they satisfy the conditions.\n\n**Error Checking and Assumptions:**\n\nWe assume that the lines intersect the circle at distinct points.

The solution involves the concepts of geometry and calculus, specifically circles, quadrilaterals, and optimization. The calculations can be verified by substituting the values back into the equations and checking if they satisfy the conditions.

{"Problem_133": "This problem involves the concept of expected value in probability theory. The expected value is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. In this case, the experiment is the coin game that Xiao Ming is playing. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of coins Xiao Ming needs to spend to pass the game. We can do this by setting up equations based on the different scenarios and solving them.\n\nLet's denote:\n- E1 as the expected number of coins Xiao Ming needs to spend to pass the game from the first door.\n- E2 as the expected number of coins Xiao Ming needs to spend to pass the game from the second door.\n- E3 as the expected number of coins Xiao Ming needs to spend to pass the game from the third door.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n- To open the first door, Xiao Ming needs to spend 2 coins.

{"Problem_139": "This problem involves the concepts of sequences, inequalities, logarithms, and absolute values. The task is to find the number of sequences that satisfy the given conditions. \n\nThe conditions are:\n1. The sequence is non-decreasing, i.e., $1 \\leqslant a_{1} \\leqslant a_{2} \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant a_{10} \\leqslant 40$.\n2. The fourth term of the sequence is at least 6, i.e., $a_{4} \\geqslant6$.\n3. The logarithm to the base 2 of the absolute difference between each term and its position in the sequence, increased by 1, is a natural number, i.e., $\\log _{2}\\left(\\left|a_{i}-i\\right|+1\\right) \\in \\mathbf{N}$ for $i=1,2, \\cdots, 10$.\n\nThe problem can be solved by considering each condition separately and then combining the results. \n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1:** Analyze the third condition. \n\nThe third condition implies that $\\left|a_{i}-i\\right|+1$ is a power of 2, i.e., $\\left|a_{i}-i\\right|+1 = 2^{n}$ for some natural number $n$. This is because the logarithm to the base 2 of a number is a natural number if and only if the number is a power of 2. \n\n**Step 2:** Solve the equation $\\left|a_{i}-i\\right|+1 = 2^{n}$ for $a_{i}$.\n\nThe equation $\\left|a_{i}-i\\right|+1 = 2^{n}$ can be rewritten as $a_{i}-i = \\pm(2^{n}-1)$. This gives two possible values for $a_{i}$: $a_{i} = i + 2^{n} - 1$ or $a_{i} = i - 2^{n} + 1$.\n\n**Step 3:** Consider the constraints on $a_{i}$.\n\nThe first condition implies that $1 \\leqslant a_{i} \\leqslant 40$ for all $i$. The second condition implies that $a_{4} \\geqslant6$. Therefore, the possible values of $a_{i}$ must satisfy these constraints.\n\n**Step 4:** Count the number of sequences that satisfy all conditions.\n\nThis step involves counting the number of sequences $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{10}$ such that each $a_{i}$ satisfies the constraints from the previous steps. This can be done by considering each $a_{i}$ separately and then multiplying the number of possibilities for each $a_{i}$.\n\n## Theoretical Justification\n\nThe solution process is based on the properties of sequences, inequalities, logarithms, and absolute values. The key insight is that the third condition implies that $\\left|a_{i}-i\\right|+1$ is a power of 2, which leads to two possible values for $a_{i}$. The constraints on $a_{i}$ are then used to narrow down the possible values of $a_{i}$.\n\n## Calculation Verification\n\nThe calculations in each step can be verified by checking that they are consistent with the given conditions and with each other. For example, the solution to the equation $\\left|a_{i}-i\\right|+1 = 2^{n}$ can be checked by substituting it back into the equation.\n\n## Error Checking and Assumptions\n\nThe solution process assumes that the sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{10}$ is non-decreasing and that $a_{4} \\geqslant6$. If these assumptions are not true, the solution may not be correct. The solution also assumes that the logarithm to the base 2 of a number is a natural number if and only if the number is a power of 2. If this assumption is not true, the solution may not be correct.\n\n## Conclusive Summary\n\nThe problem involves finding the number of sequences that satisfy certain conditions. The solution process involves analyzing the conditions, solving an equation for $a_{i}$, considering the constraints on $a_{i}$, and counting the number of sequences that satisfy all conditions. The solution is based on the properties of sequences, inequalities, logarithms, and absolute values. The calculations can be verified by checking that they are consistent with the given conditions and with each other. The solution process assumes that the sequence is non-decreasing, that $a_{4} \\geqslant6$, and that the logarithm to the base 2 of a number is a natural number if and only if the number is a power of 2.\n\nThe final answer will be calculated in the next step."}

{"Problem_148": "This problem involves the concept of difference of squares and the properties of natural numbers. The difference of squares is a mathematical identity that states that the difference of the squares of two numbers is equal to the product of the sum and difference of the numbers. In mathematical terms, this is expressed as:\n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a + b)(a - b)\n\nThe problem asks us to find the number of ways a given number can be represented as the difference of squares of two nonzero natural numbers. This involves finding pairs of natural numbers (a, b) such that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = n.\n\nThe problem then asks us to find the sum of these counts for all numbers from 1 to 100.\n\nLet's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. For each number n from 1 to 100, find all pairs of natural numbers (a, b) such that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = n.\n2. Count the number of such pairs for each n.\n3. Sum up these counts.\n\nLet's start with step 1. For a given number n, we can find pairs (a, b) by iterating over all possible values of a and b from 1 to sqrt(n). For each pair, we check if a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = n. If it does, we add the pair to our list.\n\nIn step 2, we simply count the number of pairs we found in step 1.\n\nFinally, in step 3, we sum up the counts from step 2 for all numbers from 1 to 100.\n\nHowever, there is a more efficient way to solve this problem. We can observe that a number n can be represented as a difference of squares if and only if it is odd or it is a multiple of 4. This is because the difference of two squares is always even, and the difference of two consecutive squares is always odd. Therefore, if a number is odd or a multiple of 4, it can be represented as a difference of squares. Otherwise, it cannot.\n\nUsing this observation, we can calculate the number of ways to represent a number n as a difference of squares directly, without having to find all pairs (a, b). If n is odd, there are (n + 1) / 2 ways. If n is a multiple of 4, there are n / 4 ways. Otherwise, there are no ways.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of these counts for all numbers from 1 to 100."}

{"Problem_270": "**Detailed Problem Analysis**\n\nThis problem is about finding the relative maximum of a function given its derivative. The relative maximum of a function occurs at points where the derivative of the function changes from positive to negative. This is because at a relative maximum, the slope of the function changes from increasing (positive slope) to decreasing (negative slope). \n\nThe derivative of the function is given as $f'(x) = \\ln x - x + 2$. To find the relative maximum, we need to find the critical points of the function, which are the points where the derivative is either zero or undefined. Then, we need to determine the sign of the derivative on either side of these critical points to see if it changes from positive to negative.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Find the critical points**: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$.\n\n2. **Determine the sign of the derivative on either side of the critical points**: Plug in values that are slightly less than and slightly greater than the critical points into the derivative.

The integral is of the form $\\displaystyle\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$, where $f(x) = 2x - \\sqrt{16 - x^2}$, $a = 0$, and $b = 4$.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is a combination of a linear function ($2x$) and a square root function ($\\sqrt{16 - x^2}$). The square root function is a semi-circle function, which is a part of the circle equation $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if a function $f$ is continuous over the interval $[a, b]$ and $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on $[a, b]$, then $\\displaystyle\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Find the antiderivative of $f(x)$**: The antiderivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $F(x)$, is obtained by integrating $f(x)$ with respect to $x$.

This method is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the formulas for the integrals of power and square root functions. We will verify our calculations at each step and check that our final answer is a real number. We assume that $f(x)$ is continuous over $[0, 4]$.

Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur.\n\nThe total number of socks is $7 \\times 2 = 14$. For each draw, we are removing one sock from the drawer.

Calculate the probability of drawing a matching pair on the $n$-th draw for each possible value of $n$.\n2. Identify the value of $n$ that gives the maximum probability.\n\nLet's start with step 1.

The possible values of $n$ are 2, 3, ..., 8. The minimum value is 2 because we need at least two draws to get a matching pair.

{"Problem_367": "{\n    \"answer\": 0.0,\n    \"reasoning\": \"The covariance of two independent random variables is always zero. This is because the expectation of the product of two independent random variables is the product of their expectations, i.e., E[XY] = E[X]E[Y] for independent X and Y. Therefore, Cov(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] = 0 for independent X and Y. The condition X+Y<0.5a does not affect the covariance because it does not introduce any dependence between X and Y.
