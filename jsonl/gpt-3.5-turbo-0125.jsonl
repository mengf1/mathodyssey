Uniform Distribution: The probability density function (pdf) of a uniform distribution on the interval $(a, b)$ is $f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a}$ for $a < x < b$.\n\n**Given:**\n- Single observation $X$ from ${\\rm Uniform}(0,\\theta)$ with density $f(x|\\theta)=\\frac{1}{\\theta} I(0<x<\\theta)$.\n\n**To Find:**\n- Determine if there exists a Cram\u00e9r-Rao Lower Bound for estimating the parameter $\\theta$.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n1. Calculate the likelihood function for the given scenario.\n2. Find the score function and the Fisher information.\n3. Apply the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Inequality to determine if a lower bound exists.\n\nLet's proceed with the detailed solution."}
